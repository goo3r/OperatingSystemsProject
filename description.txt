Hello!

For the regular program files they are called:
sim.java
SimProcess.java
FCFS.java
RR.java


sim.java: It's the main program file
It uses a method to read the input file and saves 
each process as an Object of type SimProcess and
puts all of the SimProcess' into an ArrayList to 
pass it to each algorithms' constructors to set 
up their ready queues. Then calls the algorithms'
doScheduling method to do the simulation.

SimProcess.java: It's a class that represents a process
This class was made to help store the data from the input
file to some form of object to later use for actual scheduling.

FCFS.java: It represents the algorithm for First Come First Serve
Its constructor takes the ArrayList of processes then sorts them
by Arrival Time and stores it into a LinkedList that implements
a Queue. doFCFSScheduling is the method that does the actual
simulation of FCFS.

RR.java: It represents the algorithm for Round Robin
Its constructor takes the ArrayList of processes then sorts them
by Arrival Time and stores it into a LinkedList that implements
a Queue. doRRScheduling is the method that does the actual
simulation of RR. A temp queue is used to act as the RR queue.


------------------------------------------------------------------

For the extra credit, we did the one that takes IO burst times:
simExtra.java
SimProcessExtra.java
FCFSExtra.java

simExtra.java: It's the main program file
It uses a method to read the input file that includes
CPU and IO burst times, and saves each process as an 
Object of type SimProcess and puts all of the 
SimProcess' into an ArrayList to pass it to each 
algorithms' constructors to set up their ready queues. 
Then calls the algorithms' doScheduling method to do 
the simulation.

SimProcessExtra.java: It's a class that represents a process
This class was made to help store the data from the input
file to some form of object to later use for actual scheduling.
This includes the IO burst times.

FCFSExtra.java: It represents the algorithm for First Come First Serve
Its constructor takes the ArrayList of processes then sorts them
by Arrival Time and stores it into a LinkedList that implements
a Queue. doFCFSScheduling is the method that does the actual
simulation of FCFS. This simulation accounts for IO burst times.
